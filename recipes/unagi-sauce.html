    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Unagi sauce is a thickened mix of soy sauce, sake, mirin and sugar.
      Traditionally used on grilled eel, it is a great source of sweetness and
      umami flavour in any dish. It is also incredibly easy to make with
      <em>mostly</em> easily in Europe available ingredients (mirin can be a bit
      difficult to come by in supermarkets).

    <ul>
      <li>180 ml mirin (If unavailable, can be substituted with 135ml sake and

      <li>4.5 Tbsp sake</li>
      <li>7.5 Tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>180 ml soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
      <li>In a small saucepan, add 60 ml mirin, 1½ Tbsp sake, and 2½ Tbsp sugar.
        Turn on the heat to medium and whisk all the ingredients together.</li>
      <li>Then, add 60 ml soy sauce and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, reduce
