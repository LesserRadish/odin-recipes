    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>First, make homemade curry powder. Start by toasting your cinnamon,
        bay leaves, cloves, cumin seeds, coriander, cardamom, and red pepper
        flakes over medium heat in a dry stainless steel saute pan. Make sure
        you keep the pan moving as not to burn your spices. Once they are
        fragrant and not quite smoking, add them to a spice grinder and blend
        them until they form a fine powder. Place in a bowl and grate 1 nutmeg
        into it. Set aside. </li>
      <li>Next, marinate your chicken. In a bowl add 1 cup of full fat yogurt,
        2 inches of grated ginger, 2 grated garlic cloves, 1 Tbsp of the
        homemade curry powder, salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Whisk
        to combine. Cut 3 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts into one inch
        cubes. Add the cubes to the yogurt mixture. Mix to combine. Cover bowl
        and place in fridge for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Spread chicken out evenly on a broiler pan in a rimmed baking sheet
        and place under the broiler on high for 10-15 minutes or until they
        register 160°F internally. </li>
      <li>For the tikka masala sauce, heat 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium
        high heat before adding ½ a small yellow onion finely minced. Cook for
        about 1 minute before adding 2 cloves of minced garlic, 2 inches of
        grated ginger, 1 small bird's eye chili finely minced, 1 Tbsp of tomato
        paste, and 1 heaping Tbsp of homemade curry powder. Mix them together
        for about 30 seconds before adding one 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes
        along with a little bit of sugar to help with the acidity. Cook for 5
        minutes.</li>
      <li>Start cooking your rice at this point, if you'd like to have
        rice.</li>
      <li>Add ¾ of a cup of heavy cream to your sauce. Stir to combine. </li>
      <li>Next add your chicken to the sauce and cook for about 5-10 minutes.
        Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed. </li>
      <li>Plate up by putting a bed of rice down first, followed by your chicken
        tikka on top, and then garnish with some cilantro.</li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
