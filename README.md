# odin-recipes
Website for recipes as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course

This is a very basic website listing recipes. The intent is to practice HTML
skills rather than making anything fancy or useful.

During this little project, I consolidated creating html boilerplate, using
headings, paragraphs and lists to present content as well as linking images and
other webpages, with both relative and absolute paths.
